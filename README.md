# CSC207-Group-Project

NOTE: This is a PUBLIC copy of a 2 year old PRIVATE repository. Which is why you will not see the contributors of the project 
here. Providing a link to the 2 year old private github repository, will not work for any non-contributors... So instead, view 
this public copy of the repository instead.



Contributors (These are Github Usernames):
	Mtttttw
	Esxyko
	wuhungmao
	Tianran-Hua



Instructions to view the project:
	Download/Clone this repository and open it up in Intellij. You will need the JavaFX library, so please download it 
	and extract into a folder (Link below). Feel free to follow the tutorial linked below, to setup JavaFX. To run the
	application itself, you need to run BoggleApp specifically, so you will need to set up a Run Configuration to do that.
	Luckily, the video linked below also shows you how to do this!
